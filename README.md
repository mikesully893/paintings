This is the source code for a recent project of mine: a prototype of a website for my girlfriend to 
sell some of her artwork. The website can be found at the following address: theartcottage.herokuapp.com

It is not yet intended to sell the paintings. The deployed version still contains Stripe's test keys
instead of live keys, so transactions are not possible.
