  <H1>My Story</H1>
  <body>
    <p>
      Born in the west of Ireland, I’ve had an interest in art for as long as I can remember.
      Often doodling my way through classes in school, academic and social demands kept me
      from spending sufficient time practising  my art skills. I studied nursing in university and
      worked for three years in hospitals in Galway, Dublin and London.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2020 amidst the global pandemic, I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 26
      which I subsequently received treatment for. I moved into a little white cottage in the
      countryside with my boyfriend and our cat Chai, who were my rocks during this difficult time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the circumstances of our return to Ireland, this little white cottage will always
      have a special place in our hearts, with many good memories formed here. This cottage, to
      me, is a place of healing and rejuvenation. After my diagnosis, the fragility of life became
      apparent to me and it enforced me to reflect on my life so far. It gave me the opportunity to
      discover who I am and what brings me joy in life. I wanted to ensure that I live my life doing
      things that make me happy and that I am passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ‘Art Cottage’ was the place where I discovered my creative side. Creating art was
      my saviour and I found it to be very therapeutic in times of uncertainty. Painting and resin art
      are the mediums I enjoy working with. I am a huge animal lover so it is no surprise that I
      enjoy painting animals.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope that you enjoy my creations and that my story inspires you to discover your
      creative side too.
